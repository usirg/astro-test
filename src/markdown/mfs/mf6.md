In this course we learned the basics of the game engine Unity and recreated the game scene from course MF2. Then we learned the basics of the C# programming language, including object-oriented programming.

With these skills we've then developed game control and game time as the first functionalities.

As an example, the video shows the creation of rectangle objects using the rectangle class developed in the course.
